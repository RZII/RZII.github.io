# Welcome to My Personal Website

This website is still under construction. I am still learning how to build and decorate a website, so it might look pretty messy for the moment.

This is my [GitHub Homepage](https://github.com/RZII), and my [LinkedIn Homepage](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanxiang-zhang-472a26223/).

### Here is the list of CS-related courses I have taken.

1. [APS 105](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps105h1), an introductory course in C language, from UofT. This was the very first CS course I had taken, and I enjoyed it quite a lot: the course content and the instructor Baochun Li were great.
2. [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com), an introductory online course in Python, taught by a professor from UMich. I did not enjoy it much because of the nature of this course: for everybody, as it stopped the course content from going into depth.


### Here is the list of courses I am currently taking.

1. [CS 61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa21/), SICP in Python, from UCB.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RZII/RZII.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
