# WelcomeÔºÅ


Hi! I am still learning how to build and decorate a website, so it might look pretty messy for the moment.

This is my [GitHub Homepage](https://github.com/RZII), and my [LinkedIn Homepage](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanxiang-zhang-472a26223/).

## A bit about me

I was born in Shanghai, China. I went to Switerland for my Highschool studying IB (International Baccalaureate).

Graduating from Highschool, I spent my freshman year (Sep 2021 - May 2022) at Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, University of Toronto. During this year, I applied for transfer admission into some universities in the US. I was admitted to College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, University of Michigan, where I decided to spend my next 3 years to study Computer Science.


### Here is a list of CS-related courses I have taken (in sequence).

1. [APS 105](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps105h1), an introductory course in C language, from UofT. This was the very first CS course I had taken, and I enjoyed it quite a lot: the course content and the instructor Baochun Li were great. This is the link of [my codes for the final project](https://github.com/RZII/APS105-Lab9-Music-Library) of this course.

2. [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com), an introductory online course in Python, taught by a professor from UMich. I did not enjoy it much because of the nature of this course: for everybody, as it stopped the course content from going into depth.

3. [CS 61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa21/), SICP in Python, from UCB. I enjoyed this course a lot, especially the projects because 3 out of 4 projects in this course are about writing a video game.  It is a lower-division CS course, but it did teach me a lot of new stuff (e.g. OOP). This is the link of [my codes repo](https://github.com/RZII/CS61A-FA21) for this course.


### Here is a list of courses I am currently taking.

1. [CS 70](https://www.eecs70.org/), Discrete Mathematics, from UCB.
2. [CS 61BL](https://cs61bl.org/su22/), Data Structures, from UCB. Sadly, I cannot share my codes repo publicly due to course policies.


## Updates
